**Author**: Cory Henderson
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This application allows users to select cities, and fetches relevant API data about their desired location including food, weather, meetups, etc.

## Getting Started
A user must develop a front end which will be dynamically updated via a server.js file.  The server JS will take user input from the front end and make API queries to various databases to get pertinent information and present them to the user.

## Architecture
This application uses express.js for server side functionality.
Sugeragent is used for server API requests.
PostgreSQL is used for SQL database management.
The application is written in Javascript.

## Change Log
02-25-2019 6:00pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for all relevant API data.

## Credits and Collaborations
Jon Gentry helped initiate the server.js files and API queries.
